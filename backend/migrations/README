Alembic migrations for the Vesta project. Instructions for managing migrations are below.

## How to manage migrations

All commands must be run from the `backend` directory (where `alembic.ini` is located).

### Create a new migration

To auto-generate a new migration script based on changes in your models:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Your migration message"
```

### Apply migrations

To apply all pending migrations to the database:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Downgrade migrations

To undo the last migration:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

```
